# visualization-learning-neural-networks
Visualize the learning process of NN (=Neural Networks) over epochs.

The NN gets trained on a function (anything the user can imagine).

Currently it's 25x25x1 Neurons, but of course you can just adapt it in train.py.

Process: Train a NN => test it => make a graph to compare the training data and the test data => repeat

The images (.png) are named so they can be imported in Shutter Encoder and make a "timelapse".
